## Provider Shop

This is nothing but just a demo of how we can make an ecommerce shop using flutter and the design pattern Provider.

If you are in a hurry to spin up an ecommerce app, you can clone this code and then you customize it 
the way you want and you'll get a nice  and simple app to maintain


And this is the basic app flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Product grid] -- press item --> B((Product details))
A --> C(Items in cart)
B --> D{Cart}
C --> D
```
